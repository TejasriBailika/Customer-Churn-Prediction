# Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn using machine learning to help businesses retain customers and reduce losses.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify patterns and build a predictive model for customer churn. Businesses can use these insights to implement retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical features.
  - Feature scaling and selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations to uncover trends and correlations.
  - Distribution analysis for key features.
- **Model Development**:
  - Training models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
  - Cross-validation for reliable performance metrics.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Tenure**: Number of months a customer has been with the company.
- **MonthlyCharges**: Monthly payment amount.
- **Contract**: Customer's subscription type (e.g., month-to-month).
